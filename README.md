# 🛡️ NoteGuard

**Automatic PII sanitisation for NHS clinical notes — clean data in, no identifiers out.**

NoteGuard discovers, inspects, redacts and de-identifies PII in free-text NHS clinical notes **before**
the data is used to train any model. It runs **locally at each institution** ("sanitise at source"), so
every Trust cleans its own data inside its own governance boundary before anything is shared or used in
collaborative / federated training.

> Federated learning lets institutions train without moving data. NoteGuard is the **privacy-preserving
> on-ramp** that makes the data safe to train on in the first place — the missing layer in front of an
> NHS Secure Data Environment / the Federated Data Platform.

**Challenge — Public Sector & Citizen Services.** Our answer to *how AI can improve public services
while protecting citizen privacy and ensuring public accountability*: AI detects the PII, a human
reviews the uncertain cases, and an audit log accounts for every removal. The NHS is the hardest,
most sensitive beachhead; the same gate generalises to local-government social care and secure
inter-agency collaboration.

Encode Vibe Coding Hackathon — *FLock Sovereign AI Challenge*, **Public Sector & Citizen Services** task (hosted by Encode Hub). Built on **Microsoft Presidio** + **spaCy**,
evaluated on [NHSEDataScience/synthetic_clinical_notes](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NHSEDataScience/synthetic_clinical_notes).

## What makes this more than "just Presidio"

Presidio is the detection **engine** — we don't reinvent it. NoteGuard is the **clinical assurance
layer** Presidio leaves to you:

1. **Measured residual leakage.** Because the dataset keeps PII in structured tables, we join them back
   to each note for free ground truth and report a real **re-identification risk** number — not a vibe.
2. **Domain adaptation to messy clinical text.** NHS-aware recognisers: checksum-validated NHS numbers
   **plus** context-anchored detection for the dataset's 9-digit synthetic numbers Presidio's `UK_NHS`
   misses, plus GMC/NMC clinician IDs, ODS org codes and record UUIDs.
3. **Patient-consistent de-identification.** Same patient → same surrogate across their whole
   admission journey. Only date-of-birth is treated as PII (shifted by a consistent per-patient
   offset); visit / admission dates are clinically useful and left intact. Realistic en_GB fakes
   (or `[label]` redaction).
4. **Pluggable + degrades gracefully.** One `Detector` interface (Rule / Presidio); the pure-Python
   rule layer + eval run even if spaCy/Presidio are unavailable.
5. **Governance wrapper.** Per-note audit of what was removed + the dataset-level leakage report,
   mapped to the NHS **Five Safes**, **Caldicott Principles**, and **DPA 2018 / UK GDPR**.
6. **Optional LLM assurance.** A free, OpenAI-compatible LLM can run as a recall-oriented safety net
   over the engine; its hits are flagged for human review, never auto-trusted (`src/llm_assure.py`).

## The public demo (two tabs people can actually use)
- **De-identify your data** — upload a `.txt` / `.csv` / `.pdf` (or paste), get de-identified data back.
  Uploads are processed **in memory only** — nothing is written to disk (asserted by `tests/test_privacy.py`).
- **Get data by domain** — pick a clinical domain (diabetes, cardiovascular, …) and download de-identified
  data drawn from the NHS synthetic notes (primary) plus a curated catalog of public free-text datasets.

## Results — residual leakage drops as we layer detection

*Known identifiers (joined from the structured tables) still present after sanitisation. Measured on all
**1,602 notes** (1,027 known-PII occurrences). Reproduce with `python tests/run_eval.py --compare`.*

| Detector | NHS number F1 | PERSON recall | **Residual leakage** |
|---|---|---|---|
| rules only | 0.98 | 0.00 | **74.8 %** |
| **presidio + rules** (shipping) | **0.99** | **0.68** | **8.5 %** |

The rules→engine drop is the headline: it shows, with numbers, exactly what the NER engine buys you.

> Precision is reported against *structured* PII only, so it is a conservative lower bound — correctly
> removing a clinician's name (not in the tables) counts here as a false positive. **Recall and leakage
> are the sound, headline metrics.**

## Trust & governance — mapped to the NHS Five Safes
- **Safe data** — PII removed to DAPB1523/ICO standard across patient + staff + org identifiers.
- **Safe settings** — runs inside the Trust; raw CSVs and the vault are gitignored, never leave.
- **Safe outputs** — only de-identified text + content-free audit logs; the measured leakage gates them.
- **Safe people / projects** — the re-identification vault stays Trust-local; pseudonymised data is
  still personal data under UK GDPR — stated honestly, no over-claim.

## Run it

```bash
# 1) create AND activate the virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1        # Windows PowerShell
# source .venv/Scripts/activate     #   ... or Windows Git Bash
# source .venv/bin/activate         #   ... or macOS / Linux

# 2) install the package (editable) + the spaCy model
pip install -e ".[app,dev]"
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg   # or en_core_web_sm for a faster, lighter run

# 3) run
python tests/run_eval.py --compare --limit 300   # reproduce the table -> outputs/results.json
python -m src.trust_demo                          # two NHS Trusts share only de-identified data -> outputs/
streamlit run streamlit_app.py                    # demo: De-identify · Get-by-domain · Metrics · Governance · Two-Trust
pytest -q                                          # unit tests
```

The dataset is pulled automatically on first run. To run fully offline, drop the three CSVs in a
folder and set `NOTEGUARD_DATA_DIR=/path/to/csvs`.

## Deploy the live demo

**Streamlit Community Cloud (free, no card — recommended).** Point <https://share.streamlit.io> at this
repo with main file `streamlit_app.py`. `requirements.txt` ships the small spaCy model so it fits the
free RAM; `build_detector` auto-uses whatever model is installed. Full steps: [docs/DEPLOY_STREAMLIT_CLOUD.md](docs/DEPLOY_STREAMLIT_CLOUD.md).

**Hugging Face Spaces (free, 16 GB — keeps `en_core_web_lg`).**

```bash
pip install -U huggingface_hub      # provides the `hf` CLI
hf auth login                        # paste a WRITE token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
hf repos create <user>/noteguard --repo-type space --space-sdk docker
git remote add space https://huggingface.co/spaces/<user>/noteguard
git push space HEAD:main             # builds the image and serves streamlit_app.py
```

## Data notes (found by inspecting the data, not assuming)
- NHS numbers in this synthetic set are **9 digits** (real ones are 10 + mod-11 check). We catch both:
  checksum-validated 10-digit anywhere, **and** context-anchored numbers after an "NHS …" label.
- Some fields are double-encoded (`Â·`); `_fix_mojibake` repairs them so they don't pollute ground truth.

Built with Claude Code (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`).
